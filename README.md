In the GA folder is is the codes for running the GA. First run make in the folder then run the python scripts which call the GA. Check the logs folder for the logs based on which test is run.

In the Linear folder same procedure is done when running the code. First make, then run the python script.

There is also some code for Qlearning, but i never made this work with the game representation for GA, therefor it was not completed.
